## Introduction

My idea is to have a place to store my notes on different topics, topics that are not tech related. I'm interested in economics, philosophy, history, and other topics. I want to have a place to store my notes and thoughts on these topics.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm not an expert in any of these topics, I'm just a curious person that likes to learn new things.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm not a native English speaker, so my writing may not be perfect and the idea is to practice my writing skills.
